# Project Title: Mail-correction API
## Project Description.
Mail correction API is an API written in Python capable of receiving an email address (correct/wrong), analyzing it to determine the issue with the email address before attempting to correct it, and then ping the mail to ensure it is genuinely active before returning the corrected version to the user. This system can be used to scan through your mailing list and instantly correct thousands of emails in order to reduce your bounce rate.
